#### 😱 *IF your NFT does not show up ...*
OpenSea is sometimes a bit *picky*. If your NFT does not show up try  **Rarible** instead. 
It's another NFT marketplace similar to OpenSea. It also has a Rinkeby testnet.  
👉🏻 Got to [Rarible](https://rinkeby.rarible.com/) and paste your deployment address (as you did in Opensea). That's it!
